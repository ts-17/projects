# About These Projects

This is a collection of my projects, experiments, and research. Each folder contains its own readme with details, code, and results.

Projects include:
- **calcofi-wasserstein**: Comparing $R^2$ and Wasserstein distance on real-world oceanographic data.

Mostly Python. Sometimes kinda cool. All mine.
