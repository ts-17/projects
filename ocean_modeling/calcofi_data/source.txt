calcofi data source: https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/

A couple of light modifications are made to the dataset. First, a merged .csv file was created to associate cast metadata with each bottle sample. In the _Bottle.csv, an invalid character in position 77 caused errors, so the column was renamed to: Oxy_mumol. This allows reading the data in utf-8 without special processing.



From the data page:
"Each file available for download includes two tables:

The Cast table contains metadata. This table includes date, time, latitude, longitude, weather, etc. for each CTD cast ever completed on a CalCOFI cruise. Each row is a unique cast, numbered sequentially/indexed by the “Cst_Cnt” column.

The Bottle table contains oceanographic data. This table includes oceanographic measurements for each bottle/sampling depth ever completed on a CalCOFI cruise. There are additional data code and precision columns describing the quality of each oceanographic measurement. Each row is a unique bottle/sampling depth, numbered sequentially/indexed by the “Btl_Cnt” column.

This table is much larger than the Cast table because each cast can have up to 24 bottles/sampling depths.

The Bottle table also has a “Cst_Cnt” column, which can be used as a unifier between the two tables.

See below for a key with descriptions and units of each column/field."
